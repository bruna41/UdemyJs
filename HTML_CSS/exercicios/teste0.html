<h3><b>Diamonds <i>(Rihanna)</i></b></h3>
<p>
Shine bright like a diamond <br>
Shine bright like a diamond <br>
Find light in the beautiful sea <br>
I choose to be happy <br>
You and I, you and I <br>
We're like diamonds in the sky <br>
You're a shooting star I see <br>
A vision of ecstasy <br>
When you hold me, I'm alive <br>
We're like diamonds in the sky <br>
I knew that we'd become one right away <br>
Oh, right away <br>
At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays <br>
I saw the life inside your eyes <br>
So shine bright, tonight you and I <br>
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky <br>
Eye to eye, so alive <br>
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky <br>
Shine bright like a diamond (uh oh-oh) <br>
Shine bright like a diamond (uh oh-oh-oh) <br>
Shining bright like a diamond <br>
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky <br>
Shine bright like a diamond (uh oh-oh) <br>
Shine bright like a diamond (uh oh-oh-oh) <br>
Shining bright like a diamond <br>
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky <br>
Palms rise to the universe <br>
As we moonshine and molly <br>
Feel the warmth, we'll never die <br>
We're like diamonds in the sky <br>
You're a shooting star I see <br>
A vision of ecstasy <br>
When you hold me, I'm alive <br>
We're like diamonds in the sky <br>
At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays <br>
I saw the life inside your eyes <br>
So shine bright, tonight you and I <br>
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky <br>
Eye to eye, so alive <br>
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky <br>
Shine bright like a diamond (uh oh-oh) <br>
Shine bright like a diamond (uh oh-oh-oh) <br>
Shining bright like a diamond <br>
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky <br>
Shine bright like a diamond (uh oh-oh) <br>
Shine bright like a diamond (uh oh-oh-oh) <br>
Shining bright like a diamond <br>
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky <br>
Shine bright like a diamond <br>
Shine bright like a diamond <br>
Shine bright like a diamond <br>
So shine bright, tonight you and I <br>
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky <br>
Eye to eye, so alive <br>
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky <br>
Shine bright like a diamond (uh oh-oh) <br>
Shine bright like a diamond (uh oh-oh-oh) <br>
Shine bright like a diamond, whoa oh yeah <br>
Shine bright like a diamond (uh oh-oh) <br>
Shine bright like a diamond (uh oh-oh, oh) <br>
Shine bright like a diamond <br>
Shine bright like a diamond <br>
